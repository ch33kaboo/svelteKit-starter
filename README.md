# svelteKit-starter

This is a repo that contains my usual dev environment with svelteKit, yours doesn't have to be like this, this works for me, customize it so that it works for you too.

The project is set up with these things: svelteKit, TS, tailwind, daisyUI, IDE settings, extension recommendation, ESLint and prettier configuration.
